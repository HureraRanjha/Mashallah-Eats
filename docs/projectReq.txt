not necessarily web
-
based
,
with
pictures to show the
descriptions
of each
dish
and price;

rated chef(s) (may or may not be the same chef).
A text area
(chat box)
is given for any user to ask questions about the restaurant an

2.
Reputation management
A c
ustomer
can fil
e complaints/compliments to
the
chef
of the
food s/he purchased and deliver person who delivered the dish
or other customers who
didn’t behave in the discussion forums
.
The d
elivery perso
n can complain/compliment
customers s/he delivered
dishes
to;
all
complaints/compliments
are handled by the
manager. The person has the right to dispute the complaint
;
the manager made the final
proj_req.docx
call to dismiss the compl
aint or let the
warning
stay
and inform the impacted parties.
Customers/delivery people whose complaints are decided
to be
without merit by the
manager will receive one
additional
warning.
Registered customers
with
3 warnings are
deregistered. VIPs having 2 warnings are put back to re
gistered customers (with warnings
cleared).
The warnings should
be displayed
o
n the page when the customer
log
s
in.
3.
Finance management
.
Every customer should deposit some money
in
to the system.
If
the price of the order is more expensive than the deposited
money in
the account, the
order is rejected
,
and
the custom
er receives one warning automatically
for being reckless
.
4.
Human resources
Customers
who are kicked out of the system or choose to quit the
system will be handled by the manager: clear the deposit
and close the account.
And
a
kicked
-
out
customer is on the blacklist of the restaurant:
they
cannot register anymore.
The chef
whose dishes received consistently low ratings (<2) or 3 complaints will be
demoted (
with a lower
salary)
;
a chef demoted twice i
s fired. Conversely, a chef whose
dishes receive high ratings (>4) or 3 compliments
will receive a bonus
. One compliment
can be used to cancel one complaint.
The delivery
people are handled the same way.
The
delivery people will compete to deliver the orde
r by bidding
;
the manager assigns the
order
based on
bidding results: the one with
the
lowest delivery price is generally chosen;
if the one with
a
higher asking price is chosen, the manager should write a memo in the
system as justification.

AI
-
based
customer service
The system tries to answer the questions from local
knowledge base, if no answers found, then delegate
s
to an LLM.
If the response to a
question in the chat box comes from the local knowledge base, the inquirer is asked to
provide a rating
. If the rating is 0 (outrageous), the answer will be flagged for the
manager to check: if the content is really bad, this item will be removed
,
and the author
will not be allowed to provide any answer.
6.
Creative feature(s)
Each
team comes up with a creativ
e
feature of the system to make it
more exciting
, e.g., image/object
-
based food search
/segmentation using foundation
models (YOLO/DINO)
, voice
-
based features, or efficient route planning for delivery
,
which is
worth 15
% of
the
overall score of the final pr
oject.
